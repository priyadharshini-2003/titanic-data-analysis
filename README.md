🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis – Summary
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover insights related to survival patterns during the infamous shipwreck. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we examine the impact of various features—such as passenger class, gender, age, fare, and embarkation point—on the likelihood of survival.

🔍 Key Findings:
Survival Rate: Approximately 38% of passengers survived.
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males, reflecting evacuation priorities.
Passenger Class: First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, while third-class passengers had the lowest.
Fare: Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive, correlating with class-based privileges.
Age: Younger passengers, particularly children, had better survival chances.
Embarked Port: Passengers who boarded at Cherbourg had higher survival rates compared to those from Southampton or Queenstown.
Family Size: Individuals traveling with small families had slightly better survival outcomes than those alone or with large families.

📊 Visualizations Used:
Heatmaps to show feature correlations
Histograms and boxplots to explore distributions and outliers
Pairplots and scatterplots to examine feature relationships with survival
Value counts and bar charts for categorical variables.

🧼 Data Considerations:
The dataset contains missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
The Cabin column was mostly null and excluded from major visualizations.
This analysis provides a foundational understanding of how socio-demographic factors influenced survival during the Titanic disaster and demonstrates how EDA techniques can reveal meaningful patterns in real-world data.
